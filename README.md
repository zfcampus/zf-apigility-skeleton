Apigility Skeleton Application
==============================

Requirements
------------

Please see the [composer.json](composer.json) file.

Installation
------------

### Via release tarball

Grab the latest release via the [Apigility website](http://apigility.org/)
and/or the [releases page](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases).
At the time of this writing, that URI is:

- https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/download/1.1.1/zf-apigility-skeleton-1.1.1.tgz

Untar it:

```bash
tar xzf zf-apigility-skeleton-1.1.1.tgz
```

### Via Composer (create-project)

You can use the `create-project` command from [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)
to create the project in one go (you need to install [composer.phar](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#downloading-the-composer-executable)):

```bash
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php --
php composer.phar create-project -sdev zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton path/to/install
```

### Via Git (clone)

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton.git # optionally, specify the directory in which to clone
cd path/to/install
```

At this point, you need to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install
dependencies. Assuming you already have Composer:

```bash
composer.phar install
```

### All methods

Once you have the basic installation, you need to put it in development mode:

```bash
cd path/to/install
php public/index.php development enable # put the skeleton in development mode
```

Now, fire it up! Do one of the following:

- Create a vhost in your web server that points the DocumentRoot to the
  `public/` directory of the project
- Fire up the built-in web server in PHP (5.4.8+) (**note**: do not use this for
  production!)

In the latter case, do the following:

```bash
cd path/to/install
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public public/index.php
```

You can then visit the site at http://localhost:8080/ - which will bring up a
welcome page and the ability to visit the dashboard in order to create and
inspect your APIs.

### NOTE ABOUT USING THE PHP BUILT-IN WEB SERVER

PHP's built-in web server did not start supporting the `PATCH` HTTP method until
5.4.8. Since the admin API makes use of this HTTP method, you must use a version
&gt;= 5.4.8 when using the built-in web server.

### NOTE ABOUT USING APACHE

Apache forbids the character sequences `%2F` and `%5C` in URI paths. However, the Apigility Admin
API uses these characters for a number of service endpoints. As such, if you wish to use the
Admin UI and/or Admin API with Apache, you will need to configure your Apache vhost/project to
allow encoded slashes:

```apache
AllowEncodedSlashes On
```

This change will need to be made in your server's vhost file (it cannot be added to `.htaccess`).

### NOTE ABOUT OPCACHE

**Disable all opcode caches when running the admin!**

The admin cannot and will not run correctly when an opcode cache, such as APC or
OpCache, is enabled. Apigility does not use a database to store configuration;
instead, it uses PHP configuration files. Opcode caches will cache these files
on first load, leading to inconsistencies as you write to them, and will
typically lead to a state where the admin API and code become unusable.

The admin is a **development** tool, and intended for use a development
environment. As such, you should likely disable opcode caching, regardless.

When you are ready to deploy your API to **production**, however, you can
disable development mode, thus disabling the admin interface, and safely run an
opcode cache again. Doing so is recommended for production due to the tremendous
performance benefits opcode caches provide.

### Vagrant

If you prefer to develop with Vagrant, there is a basic vagrant recipe included with this project.

This recipe assumes that you already have Vagrant installed. The virtual machine will try to use localhost:8080 by
default, so if you already have a server on this port of your host machine, you need to shut down the conflicting
server first, or if you know how, you can reconfigure the ports in Vagrantfile.

Assuming you have Vagrant installed and assuming you have no port conflicts, you can bring up the Vagrant machine
with the standard `up` command:

```
vagrant up
```

When the machine comes up, you can ssh to it with the standard ssh forward agent:

```
vagrant ssh
```

The web root is inside the shared directory, which is at `/vagrant`. Once you've ssh'd into the box, you need to cd:

```
cd /vagrant
```

For vagrant documentation, please refer to [vagrantup.com](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

### Docker

If you develop or deploy using Docker, we provide both development and production configuration for
you.

#### Development

Prepare your development environment using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton

cd zf-apigility-skeleton

docker-compose build
```

Start the development environment:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
Access your editor from `http://localhost:8080/` or `http://<boot2docker ip>:8080/` if on Windows or Mac.

#### Production

Use the included [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/) to build an [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) container:
```bash
docker build -t apighost .
```

Test your container:
```bash
docker run -it -p "80:80" apighost
```
