Apigility Skeleton Application
==============================

Installation
------------

### Via release tarball

Grab the latest release via the [Apigility website](http://apigility.org/)
and/or the [releases page](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases).
At the time of this writing, that URI is:

- https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/releases/download/0.6.0/zf-apigility-skeleton.tgz

Untar it:

```bash
tar xzf zf-apigility-skeleton.tgz
```

### Via Composer (create-project)

You can use the `create-project` command from [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)
to create the project in one go:

```bash
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php --
php composer.phar create-project -sdev zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton path/to/install
```

### Via Git (clone)

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton.git # optionally, specify the directory in which to clone
cd path/to/install
```

At this point, you need to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install
dependencies. Assuming you already have Composer:

```bash
composer.phar install
```

### All methods

Once you have the basic installation, you need to put it in development mode:

```bash
cd path/to/install
php public/index.php development enable # put the skeleton in development mode
```

Now, fire it up! Do one of the following:

- Create a vhost in your web server that points the DocumentRoot to the
  `public/` directory of the project
- Fire up the built-in web server in PHP (5.4.8+) (**note**: do not use this for
  production!)

In the latter case, do the following:

```bash
cd path/to/install
php -S 0:8080 -t public/ public/index.php
```

You can then visit the site at http://localhost:8080/ - which will bring up a
welcome page and the ability to visit the dashboard in order to create and
inspect your APIs.

### NOTE ABOUT USING PHP BUILT-IN WEB SERVER

PHP's built-in web server did not start supporting the `PATCH` HTTP method until
5.4.8. Since the admin API makes use of this HTTP method, you must use a version
&gt;= 5.4.8 when using the built-in web server.

### NOTE ABOUT OPCACHE

If you add new things (like REST Services) through Admin interface, but they do not show up, disable opcache. Apigility is not using database to store configuration. Instead all configuration information is handled through PHP files. If they get cached with opcache, Admin interface can't function normally. Reminder: Admin interface should be used only in **devlopment** environment. You can enable opcache in **production** environment as there is no need for Admin interface and thus opcache can't cause any problems.
